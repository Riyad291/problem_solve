Your instructor had reasonable expectation that you can receive a passing grade after completing the missing assignments and agreed to work with you to make up the missing work. You also agreed with your instructor to finish the missing work. You may still have time to finish your missing work to receive a letter grade before your INC grade turns to an "FIN". </p>
